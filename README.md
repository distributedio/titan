A distributed implementation of __Redis compatible layer__  based on [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/)

## Why Titan?

* Completely compatible with Redis protocol
* Full distributed transaction with strong consistency
* Multi-tenancy support
* No painful scale out
* High availability

Thanks [TiKV](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/) for supporting the core features. The project is developed and open sourced by the Beijing Infrastructure Team at [Meitu](https://www.meitu.com/) and has been donated to [DistributedIO](https://github.com/distributedio) org.
